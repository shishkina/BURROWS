#TIC TAC TOW

This is an excellent opportunity to plan and breakdown a problem first on paper (or your desk) and understand its components before tackling the code. Work with a partner, play some TicTacToe on paper and talk about how it actually works.

So far we've used:
- `strings`
- `numbers`
- `arrays`
- `objects`
- `functions`
- `booleans`
- `control flow structures`
- `DOM`

Think about which of these tools you are going to need to build this game. What are the pros/cons of each of these tools? What are the attributes of these tools that you can exploit to help model this real world game in a way that your computer can understand?

_To guide your way_

Write out an algorithm based on how you play TicTacToe with a pen and paper.

- What is Tic Tac Toe? How is it played?
- What does it look like?
- How can you represent this programmatically?
