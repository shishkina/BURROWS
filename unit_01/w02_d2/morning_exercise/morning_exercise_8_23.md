# WORD FREQUENCY

### Find the most frequent word in a sentence

Write a function or functions that takes in a sentence (string), and returns which word appears in the sentence with the highest frequency, along with the frequency of the word.

Make it just for sentences without commas, apostrophes, and periods. Adjust for capital letters.

If there is a tie between the two most frequent words, the first appearing one is returned.

Example:

```
wordFreq("The world is all that the case")
=> { the: 2 }
```

```
wordFreq("That that is is that that not is not")
=> { that: 4 }
```

```
wordFreq("hi")
=> { hi: 1 }
```
