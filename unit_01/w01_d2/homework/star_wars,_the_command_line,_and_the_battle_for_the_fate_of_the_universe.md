# Star Wars, the Command Line, and The Battle for the Fate of the Universe

Working in the command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. It's a big break from what you're used to, and practice makes (eventually) perfect. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line!

Please record your commands underneath each bullet point in this markdown. 

As you work, make sure you `git add .` and `git commit -m "[YOUR MESSAGE HERE]"`!

## "A New Hope"
### Act I

* In your unit01/w01_d2/homework directory, create a new directory called `star_wars`.

> Example answer: `mkdir star_wars`

* In the `star_wars` folder, create two new directories: `empire` and `rebellion`.

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`.

* Use the force (or your knowledge of the command line) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the `darth_vader` file. (Don't remember how to do this? Use the `other force`, known as Google!)

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a directory called `death_star`.

* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`.

### Act II

* Move back to your `star_wars` directory, and enter the `rebellion` directory.

* Create a file called `princess_leia` and add the text "Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope."

* Create a file called `obi_wan`.

* Create a file called `luke_skywalker`.

* Create a directory called `millenium_falcon`.

* Inside the `millenium_falcon`, create two files: `han_solo` and `chewy`.

* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi_wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`.

* Move the `millenium_falcon` into the `death_star`.

### Act III

* Unload the Millenium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millenium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory.

* `darth_vader` has defeated `obi_wan`! Delete poor `obi_wan`.

* Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the `millenium_falcon`! Remember: `darth_vader` remains in the `death_star` and `emperor_palpatine` is still in the `empire`.

* Move the `millenium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory.

* `darth_vader` leaves the `death_star` to persue Luke! Move him from the `death_star` into the `empire` directory!

* Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar's Canyon, Luke blew up the `death_star`! Remove it from the galaxy! :boom:
