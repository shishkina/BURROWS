#Week 1 Project

###The Beginning of Your Portfolio

###About Me

This week you're going to build an original About Me website that tells the visitor through content and design more about your skills and personality.  Maybe a bit about what you like to do outside of coding.  Think about your personal brand.  Its important to be authentic and utilize all technologies that are required.  This will be the start of your portfolio, which you will use to showcase your projects throughout your time at GA.  It is an evolving thing that will be essential for a successful outcomes process.

	Tip:  Plan ahead!  Take a few minutes to sketch or whiteboard a design. Challenge yourself!
