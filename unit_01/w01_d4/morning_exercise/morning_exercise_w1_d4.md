-  Write an adventure story in a paragraph.
-  You'll need to remove key verbs and nouns. Your users will enter their own values for these.  For example: Today, I was [ x ] to [ y ]! On my way, I encountered [ z ]! I had to use my [ u ] to escape the horrible clutches of [ q ]! All in a day's work as a [ k ].
-  You must use prompt() to ask your users at least five questions. These questions will determine the words used in your story. These answers should be assigned to a variable.
-  You must use all JavaScript primitive datatypes at least once.
-  You should use at least two conditional statements when building your adventure.
-  Try your classmate's adventure story out.

###Bonus
-  Find the documentation for a JavaScript Array.  Use an array to store your user's input. (Look up the method for "pushing" values into an array). 
-  You will then need to use the values in the array to build your adventure paragraph.
