#Build A Website About Lunches
Please complete all Objectives and try tackling the bonuses on the bottom

## 1st Objective: Organizing Your File Structure
- Organize Your Website

	- From your homework directory, create a folder called "places-for-lunch"
	
	- In the "places-for-lunch" folder, create a .html file called "index.html" 

	- In the "places-for-lunch" folder, create a new folder called "styles"
	
	- In the "styles" folder, create a new file called "styles.css"
	
	- In the "places-for-lunch" folder, create a new folder called "javascript"
	
	- In the "javascript" folder, create a new file called "lunch.js"

## 2nd Objective: Let's Get Git In Place
This could be a good time for you to commit your changes.  Remember Git is here to help track those changes for you.  The syntax should be familiar but use the additional resources section for documentation. 

- Go to unit_01/w01_d4/homework and perform the following:

	- Stage your changes. 
	 
	- Commit your work with a message. 
	
	- Push to origin Master
	
- Go to GitHub.com and view your changes in unit_01/w01_d4/homework


## 3rd Objective: Build and Style Your Website

Your website will be about places to grab lunch from Monday to Friday.  Below is a rough mockup of what your page should look like.  You do not have to copy the colors or font but try your best to make your website's structure look exactly the same.  

- Link together the index.html and styles.css files using the link tag in the head of your html file.

- Before proceeding, test it. Make the body's background color orange and open the file in the browser.

- If it works, stage, commit with a message and push your changes to GitHub.

- The website should contain a header with an h1 element, body and footer with an h1 element.  Each day could be a div element with nested unordered lists and paragraph elements for the addresses but the choice is yours.

Please note that each "Name" in the mockup is a clickable anchor element.  Each url listed below can be placed in an anchor element's href attribute which should look like this ```<a href="url goes here">Name of Restaurant</a>```
