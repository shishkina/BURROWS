## Trip To MorDOMr

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice using 'jQuery' to manipulate the DOM

You've taken a trip from the shire across Middle Earth and its been so wonderful that you want to code your way through it with jQuery.

### Step 1-13

Last week you worked on the 13 functions found in the app.js file.  Tonight please implement those JavaScript functions using jQuery or feel free to solve the problems again.  You've learned a lot in one week.  

Remember you can check your DOM tree in the Elements tab in Chrome Console.

**Workflow**

Tackle this problem one function from start to finish at a time.

Same as before, each function should depend on the previous ones, so make sure your function works before moving on to the next one!

Every time you refresh the page, you will have to click the buttons one by one
in order from the beginning to operate your application.
