##Connect Four Tests

Tonight you will be writing tests using Jasmine for a Connect Four game.  The app has already been built but...it may not be perfect.  

"Tests are where dreams are made."

##Jasmine
Make sure you have installed the jasmine-node package.

##Tests
You will be creating tests for the Game, Board and Cell classes.  If you haven't played Connect Four, here are the rules...

"The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent." - Wikipedia

Run the app in your Chrome browser and play the game to get a sense of how it works.  

From scratch, you need to create a test suite that runs tests on all of the properties and methods of each class to guarantee that the game is working appropriately. Make sure to ```require``` the correct JavaScript files in each of your specs.   We've created a directory called ``spec`` with a few empty JavaScript files.  Please reference Will's code from today.      

##Bonus Dream Test
Also included in this homework directory is a copy of Andrew's solution to Conway's Game of Life.  Andrew is an awesome developer but needs that extra bit of confidence.  Create a spec for the CoordinateHelper Class.
