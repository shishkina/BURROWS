#Part 1.  React-Router Practice

###Monkey App

The routes below should render different components

When you hit the ``'/'`` route an h1 should render with the text **"What should the monkey do?"
**

There should be three Links on the index page that contain the html **Monkey Eats Cheerios**, **Monkey Eats Frosted Flakes**, and **Monkey Says Hello**.

Create routes that take in parameters for what the monkey should eat and what the monkey should say. They may look like this.

``monkey/says/:statement``

``monkey/eats/:something``

When the **Monkey Eats Cheerios** link is clicked, an h1 is rendered with the text "The Monkey is eating Cheerios".

When the **Monkey says Hello** link is clicked an h1 is rendered with the text "The Monkey says hello".
