#Rebuilding an App With React

This weekend you will be using Andrew's example and other resources to rebuild the social network/posts exercise using React and Firebase for persistent data.    

[Andrew's Tutorial](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_NYC_BURROW/tree/master/unit_02/w05_d5/lectures/SocialNetwork)

These are some steps to think about.  Try to plan before you dive in.

####1.  Read through the README from today's lecture and setup your environment.

####2.  Create your file structure.

####3. Setup up ESlint to make sure you're following the style guide.

####4.  Create a full CRUD application, which will involve GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE requests to a Firebase.  User interactions should make these requests and render the appropriate state on the DOM.  

####5.  Commenting your code.  It is a helpful exercise to go through your code and add comments to make it more readable for other developers.

####6.  Styling.  It should look different than Andrew's example but implement the same functionality.

The repetition and practice will make you a better developer.  This is also a dry run for your project!  Don’t say author and content… rather say…  dog  and dream…  or name and experience.  Change it up and you'll see that you have the tools to make a variety of web applications.
