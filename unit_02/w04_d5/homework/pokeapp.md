Here is the documentation...

###[PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/docsv2/#resource-lists)

##Objective 1
Build an app that renders the names of the first 151 Pokémon introduced in Pokémon Red and Blue, in the pokéapi database on page load.  When the user clicks a name, the app should render information about that Pokémon, including the name and weight.
