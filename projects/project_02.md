# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: C.R.U.D.

### Overview

* A VAST majority of the internet is based on C.R.U.D.  
* Now it's your turn to apply your own interests to a C.R.U.D. application with a React based Front-End.
* MAKE IT LOOK GOOD!  Spend the **TIME** to style your application. 

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

---

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Application must allow for FULL C.R.U.D. of at least one resource**
* Use **REACT JS** for managing your view layer
* Use **FIREBASE** for storing your data
* **Deploy your website online**, where the rest of the world can access it.
* Use **Authentication** so a user can sign-in
* Show effort in **styling**

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working application, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working application** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted app, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

---

### Suggested Next Steps
* Could you download a large dataset and use it somehow?  NYC Open Data?
* Could users OWN items?  That is to say could each user have different recipes (for example)
* Could there be more than one full resource C.R.U.D. application?  For example, could somone write a Haiku... and then others comments on it?

### Necessary Deliverables

---

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Recipes
- Allow a user to manage their personal recipes!

##### Itinerary Application
- Allows a user to manage iteneraries with lists of things to do

##### Weather Advisor
- Add location to a database
- The application can then, using a weather api, inform you of ALL the weathers

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

* __Deployment__: Did you deploy your application to a public url using GitHub Pages?

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
