# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Your Portfolio of Apps

It is the final unit of the 'in-class' portion of WDI, i.e. the independent section!

During this section, you are to deliver a portfolio site complete with your class projects and the below listed applications. Each should be their own GitHub repository.

---

### Required applications:
- Rails API - Service
- Express & React Application - Consumer and Service (i.e. a fan-mail sign-up app)
- Independent Application - Any pattern and tech stack of your choice
- Your **Personal** portfolio website showcasing all of your projects

---

### Independent Application:
In this project you will build your own `service` and `client` applications.  This can potentially include but is not limited to Firebase, Rails, Sinatra, or an Express backend.  

#### Service:
A `Service`, in this project, will be an assortment of JSON endpoints which provide data and/or compute something given input data.
 
 - Examples:
    - Data API:
      - Find large dataset without an existing API
        - Search for interesting CSV or JSON files for example
      - Process the data and provide API
        - For example...
          - how many flights were delayed due to the snow on Thanksgiving 2015? (and other flight-related questions)
          - what is the average yearly precipitation in Zimbabwe?
    - Service API:
      - Given some input data, provide processed response
        - For example...
          - a markov model for processing text (i.e. SkakeItSpeare)

#### Client:
A `Client`, in this project, will be a JavaScript heavy, browser-based application with a focus on the user experience that interacts with a service via AJAX.  This can be using vanilla JavaScript (ES6) by itself, or making use of a front-end framework/library like React JS.  That choice is yours to make.
