##iPod Classic

Let's draw an iPod Classic using HTML/CSS!  Please work with a partner!

###Step 0 (Command Line)

* Navigate to your directory in our repository for Week 1 Day 2.
* Make a directory there for `ipod` and navigate into this directory.
* Make an html file called `index.html`.
* Make a css file called `style.css`.
* Open these files in your text editor.
* Open `index.html` in Chrome.

###Step 1 (File Structure)

* Setup your `index.html` boilerplate.  Please type this into your file (NO COPY AND PASTE!!!!):
```html
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Great BEST Title Here</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"></script>
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
  </html>
```

###Step 2 (Draw an iPod!)

Some pointers/pro-tips/resources.

* Break down the example iPod picture in terms of its visual components.
* Think about how to lay these components within/on top of each other.
* [Colours](http://colours.neilorangepeel.com/)
* [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Examples)

###Step 3 (Make it your iPod!)

* Change the Screen content to have a suite image/video (Google it!).
* iPod's used to be in many wacky colours!
* Use border's to make it have a more 3-D look/feel.
