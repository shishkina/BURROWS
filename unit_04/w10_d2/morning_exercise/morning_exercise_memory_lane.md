###1.  Read this wonderful description of Modules
This is an awesome tutorial to reference.  It covers a ton of basic Ruby without all of the sugar.  You'll see modules often in code.  Requiring a module in Ruby is very similar to requiring a module in Node.

Create a directory and build a quick module.

# MEMORY LANE

Remember some of those morning exercises we did in Javascript? Revisit these exercises one-by-one. We already have an idea how to approach them having done them before, so let's try to solve them again while also translating them to Ruby.

### 2. EULER PROBLEM 1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### 3. PANDIGITAL NUMBERS

A number of length n is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once.

- The leading digital cannot be '0'

- The number `15234` is 1 through 5 pandigital.

- The number `333` is not pandigital.

- The number `0` is not pandigital.

- The number `987654321` is pandigital. 

####DIRECTIONS...
Write a function that checks if a number is pandigital.

### 4. BONUS: PALINDROME
Make a ruby method that returns true if a string is a palindrome, false if not. Make sure it returns the correct result for words with capital letters.
